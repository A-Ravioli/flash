# Flash: Neural Network and Tensor Library from Scratch

A pure Python implementation of a neural network and tensor library, built entirely from scratch with no external dependencies.

## Overview

Flash is a comprehensive library implementing:

- A tensor computation library
- Automatic differentiation engine
- Neural network primitives
- Deep learning models including:
  - Feedforward neural networks
  - Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
  - Transformers

## Structure

- `core/` - Core tensor operations and data structures
- `autodiff/` - Automatic differentiation engine
- `nn/` - Neural network components
  - `layers/` - Basic building blocks like Linear, Conv2D
  - `activations/` - Activation functions
  - `models/` - Complete model implementations
  - `losses/` - Loss functions 
  - `optimizers/` - Optimization algorithms
- `data/` - Data handling utilities
- `utils/` - Helper functions and utilities
- `examples/` - Example implementations
- `tests/` - Unit tests

## Getting Started

Flash is built from scratch with no dependencies beyond Python's standard library.

```python
# Example usage (once implemented)
from flash.core import Tensor
from flash.nn.models import MLP

# Create a tensor
x = Tensor([1, 2, 3, 4])

# Create a simple neural network
model = MLP(input_size=10, hidden_sizes=[64, 32], output_size=1)
```

## Implementation Plan

1. Implement core tensor operations
2. Build automatic differentiation
3. Create basic neural network components
4. Develop optimization algorithms
5. Build model architectures
6. Add utilities for training and evaluation
